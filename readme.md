# Polling Layout Instability (React)

The scope of this demo is a continuation of the work done on [poll-layout-instability-react](https://github.com/kevinfarrugia/poll-layout-instability-react) and [poll-layout-instability](https://github.com/kevinfarrugia/poll-layout-instability) to illustrate the problem with layout shifting caused by appending DOM elements above the contents in the user's viewport within a ReactJS application using [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/).
